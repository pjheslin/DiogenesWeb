# Longer term
## Epub export of texts for mobile reading
I think it would make sense to implement the epub export functionality as part of DiogenesWeb, since it already has code to convert the XML of Diogenes/Perseus, etc. to HTML.  It is written in Node/Javascript, and it seems that there is an epub creation library:  https://github.com/bbottema/js-epub-maker
