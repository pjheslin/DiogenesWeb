  <h1>Using Dropbox</h1>
  <p>
    If you upload XML files of Latin and Greek texts to a special folder within your Dropbox account, DiogenesWeb can access them and you can read these just as you can the open-access texts.  This includes texts exported fom the Diogenes desktop application.  Here are step-by-step instructions on how to upload texts to Dropbox.
  </p>
  <h2>Opening a Dropbox Account</h2>
  <p>
    Skip this step if you already have a Dropbox account.  Sign up for a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/basic">free Dropbox account</a>, also called a Basic account (not a Business account).  Currently, a free account comes with 2GB of storage, which is plenty for the purpose of DiogenesWeb.
  </p>
  <h2>Download the Dropbox desktop application</h2>
  <p>
    After creating an account, on Windows and Mac you will be invited to download the Dropbox desktop application onto your computer, which is the easiest way to use Dropbox.
  </p>
  <p>
    Installing the application will create a Dropbox folder on your computer.  Anything you put in that folder will automatically be uploaded to your Dropbox account.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't want to use or cannot use the Dropbox desktop application, you can just upload texts manually via the Dropbox website.
  </p>

  <h2>Create the DiogenesWeb App Folder on Dropbox</h2>
  <p>
    Do not create the DiogenesWeb folder manually; let Dropbox create it for you.  To do this, point your browser at <a href="https://d.iogen.es/web">DiogenesWeb</a>, go to the page that has the button marked "Go to My Dropbox", and click on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will now be taken to a page on the Dropbox website where you will be asked to authorize DiogenesWeb to access its own folder inside your account.  If you are not already signed into Dropbox on that browser, you will be asked to enter your password.  DiogenesWeb never sees your password, and can only ever access the DiogeneWeb folder in your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have authorized DiogenesWeb with Dropbox, you will taken to a page on which DiogenesWeb reports "Success!".  At this point, Dropbox will have automatically created a new folder in your Dropbox account called "Apps" (if it did not exist already), and within "Apps" another folder called "DiogenesWeb"
  </p>

  <h2>Uploading XML Texts</h2>
  <p>
    Now you can upload any XML texts you like to the Dropbox > Apps > DiogeneWeb folder (and that folder can contain subfolders).  If you installed the Dropbox app, just copy them to the Dropbox folder on your computer and they will be uploaded automatically.  If not, you can upload files to the DiogenesWeb folder via the Dropbox website.
  </p>

  <h2>Exporting Texts from Diogenes</h2>
  <p>
    You can export texts directly from the Diogenes desktop application to your DiogenesWeb Dropbox folder.  Select "Export" on the desktop app, then choose the corpus and (optionally) the authors you wish to export.  Now click on the "Output Folder" button and select Dropbox/Apps/DiogenesWeb.  Start the export process and wait for it to end with the message "Finished XML Conversion".
  </p>

  <h2>Waiting for Texts to Upload</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have uploaded files, or copied them or exported them into your local Dropbox folder for automatic uploading, it may take time for that process to finish.  If you are using the Dropbox app, click on the desktop icon, and if it says "Up to date" the automatic upload has finished.
  </p>

  <h2>Refreshing the Dropbox File List</h2>
  <p>
    Once your texts have finished uploading to Dropbox, you need to tell DiogenesWeb to refresh its listing of the contents of the app folder.  Return to your browser or point it once again at <a href="https://d.iogen.es/web">DiogenesWeb</a>.  If you are on the page that reports your successful authentication, click on the button that says "Show Dropbox Files".
  </p>
  <p>
    You may be surprised when you go to the listing of Dropbox files and see nothing there.  That is because, after each time you upload files to your app folder, you need to tell DiogenesWeb to ask Dropbox for a refreshed listing of all the files the app folder contains.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click on "Refresh List", and wait for Dropbox to transmit a new list of the files in the app folder and its subfolders.  You should then see a list of those files, categorized where possible.  You can now open and read these texts as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should not have to refresh the list of files on that browser again unless you upload new texts. If you ever wish to remove the access you have granted to DiogenesWeb to its app folder, you can disconnect it via your account settings on the Dropbox website (or just delete the DiogenesWeb app folder).
