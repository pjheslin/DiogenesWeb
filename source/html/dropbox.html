  <h1>How to use Dropbox</h1>
  <p>
    DiogenesWeb can access XML files of Latin and Greek texts within your Dropbox account,  and you can read these cloud-hosted files just as you can the open-access texts.   Here are step-by-step instructions on how to upload texts to Dropbox.
  </p>
  <h2>Opening a Dropbox account</h2>
  <p>
    Skip this step if you already have a Dropbox account.  Sign up for a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/basic">free Dropbox account</a>, also called a Basic account (not a Business account).  Currently, a free account comes with 2GB of storage, which is plenty for the purpose of DiogenesWeb.
  </p>
  <h2>Install the Dropbox desktop application</h2>
  <p>
    After creating an account, on Windows and Mac you will be invited to download the Dropbox desktop application onto your computer, which is the easiest way to use Dropbox.
    Installing the application will create a Dropbox folder on your computer.  Anything you put in that folder will automatically be uploaded to your Dropbox account.
  </>
  <p>
    If you don’t want to use or cannot use the Dropbox desktop application, you can just upload texts manually via the Dropbox website.
  </p>

  <h2>Create the DiogenesWeb app folder on Dropbox</h2>
  <p>
    Do not create the DiogenesWeb folder manually; let Dropbox create it for you.  To do this, point your browser at <a href="https://d.iogen.es/web">DiogenesWeb</a>, go to the page that has the button marked "Go to My Dropbox”, and click on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will now be taken to a page on the Dropbox website where you will be asked to authorize DiogenesWeb.  If you are not already signed into Dropbox on that browser, you will be asked to enter your password.  DiogenesWeb never sees your password, and it can only ever access the DiogeneWeb folder in your Dropbox account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have authorized DiogenesWeb with Dropbox, you will taken to a page on which DiogenesWeb reports “Success!”.  At this point, Dropbox will have automatically created a folder in your Dropbox account called “Apps” (if it did not exist already), and within “Apps” another folder called “DiogenesWeb”
  </p>

  <h2>Uploading XML texts</h2>
  <p>
    Now you can upload any XML texts you like to the Dropbox > Apps > DiogeneWeb folder (and that folder can contain subfolders).  If you installed the Dropbox app, just copy them to the Apps > DiogenesWeb subfolder within the Dropbox folder on your computer and they will be uploaded automatically.  Otherwise you can upload files to the DiogenesWeb folder via the Dropbox website.
  </p>

  <h2>Exporting texts from the Diogenes desktop app</h2>
  <p>
    You can export texts directly from the Diogenes desktop application to your DiogenesWeb Dropbox folder.  Select “Export” on the desktop app, then choose the corpus and (optionally) the authors you wish to export.  Now click on the “Output Folder” button and select the correct folder.  If you have the Dropbox app installed, this will be Dropbox/Apps/DiogenesWeb within your home directory.  Start the export process and wait for it to end with the message “Finished XML Conversion”.
  </p>

  <h2>Waiting for texts to upload</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have copied or exported files into your local Dropbox folder for automatic uploading, or have uploaded files via the Dropbox website, it will take time for that process to finish.  If you are using the Dropbox app, click on the desktop icon, and if it says “Up to date” the automatic upload has finished.
  </p>

  <h2>Refreshing the Dropbox file list</h2>
  <p>
    Once your texts have finished uploading to Dropbox, DiogenesWeb will need to refresh its listing of the contents of your Dropbox app folder.  Return to your browser or point it once again at <a href="https://d.iogen.es/web">DiogenesWeb</a>.  If you are on the page that reports your successful authentication, click on the button that says “Show Dropbox Files”.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the listing says “loading entries …”, DiogenesWeb is in the process of asking Dropbox for a refreshed listing of all the files the app folder contains.  If that has not happened automatically, click on “Refresh List”, and wait for Dropbox to transmit a new list of the files in the app folder and its subfolders.  Each subsequent time you upload new files to your Dropbox app folder, you need to click on that button to tell DiogenesWeb to refresh its listing.
  </p>
  <p>
  You should eventually see a list of your files, categorized where possible.  You can now open and read these texts as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
 If you ever wish to remove the access you have granted to DiogenesWeb to its Dropbox app folder, you can disconnect it via your account settings on the Dropbox website (or just delete the DiogenesWeb app folder).
